<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hello i am net-js and i made this site <a href="/" target="_blank"><code>Blogy</code></a> i am kind of new to
    programing 3 years so thats why this is not the best of blogging sites but it is one atleast. i hope. i guess</p>
<p>I am a self taught programmer doing both backend using node.js i love using node.js because its easy and i can make
    anything i want with it like this site or a <code>CLI Tool</code> or a <code>Web Server</code> or <code>Desktop apps
        - electron</code> without learning another language just JavaScript which is also amazing Etc you get the point
</p>
<h1>History</h1>
<p>
    I was first a app maker using <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/">Mit App Inventor</a> but i would promote using
    <a href="https://kodular.io">Kodular</a> same thing but two diffrences one its closed source and two it supports
    more features
    <br />
    <br />
    Ok that aside i used to develop lots of apps like a ton then this that i needed a website to host my apps i don't
    have a play store account so to host my app i needed a site fun fact i deployed it to <code>firebase hosting</code> due to it
    being free and i used <code>firebase</code>
    then i got into <code>web development</code> then backend this that now i am here and if your thinking where all the apps and
    sites i made went... I will tell that later üòÅ so be alert
</p>
